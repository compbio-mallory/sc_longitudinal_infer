The default values, if not specified in this level, are used and specified here:    

t = 3:                   3 timepoints with t = 1 being the root (varying t = 3 (default), 4 and 5)
alpha = 0.01:            false positive rates (varying a = 0.001, 0.01 (default), 0.03 and 0.05)
beta = 0.2:              false negative rates (varying b = 0.1, 0.2 (default), 0.3 and 0.4)
missing rate = 0.2:      (varying m = 0.2 (default) and 0.3)
# of cells at each timepoint:	for t=3, 100 and 500 (0 cells at root)
				for t=4, 500, 1000 and 1500
				for t=5, 200, 500, 1500 and 1800
t_v [Value in timepoints]:	for t = 3, [15, 7, 0]
				for t = 4, [20, 12, 6, 0]
				for t = 5, [25, 18, 10, 4, 0]
beta in splitting = 0.2: (varying B = 0.05, 0.2 (default) and 0.5)
u (threshold for multiple splits): (varying u = 0, 0.1, 0.2 (default), 0.3)
[v1,v2] (decide if node is dying, splitting or doesn't split): [0.2, 0.4](default) and [0.05, 0.2]
a (mutation constant for Poisson dist): 1.2, 1.7 (default) and 2.

In non t* (leaf number) or s* (splitting) folders, the tree structures are the same as those in t8.

In total there are the following folders:
    t4, t8, t16, t32 
    ap001, ap05
    bp1, bp3, bp4
    mp3
    N100, N1000, N1500
    M50, M500
    sp05, sp5

Each folder has only one variable varying. If not specified, all the variables are by default. The data in t8 have all variables at default. 

Each folder has five repetitions, each repetition has a different tree structure. 

In total there are 17 folders * 5 repetitions = 85 datasets created. 

Notice that sp05 may create some data whose cluster number is < expected, as some leaves are totally empty. This may also unintentionally happen in sp5 or the default s.
